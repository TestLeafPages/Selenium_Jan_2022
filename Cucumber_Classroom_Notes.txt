Cucumber Classroom Notes:

TDD - Test Driven Development
-----------------------------
- Write the test cases first based on the requirement
- Test cases should be apporved by the project team
- Development will be based on the test cases


ATDD - Aceptance Test Driven Development:
-----------------------------------------
- Write the acceptance test cases first based on the requirement
- Test cases should be apporved by the project team
- Development will be based on the test cases 

Con: Communication gap between the Technical (Dev & Testers)
     team and Non Technical team (Client /product owner)

BDD - Behaviour Driven Development:
-----------------------------------
To address the communication gap between tech and non tech team
- Write the test scenarios using Gherkin (common) language
  first
- Approve the test scenarios
- BDD test scenarios will drive the development


Gherkin Keywords:
------------------
Feature  - Used to describe the functionality
Scenario - Used to describe the test case
Given - Used to represent pre-requisite for a scenario
When - Used to represent test step / test condition
Then - Used to represent the expected result for positive scenario
But - Used to represent the expected result for negative scenario

How to parameterize the data from feature file
===============================================
1. Enclose the data with '' in the feature file
2. Replace the data in the cucucmber annotation text with {string}
3. Create argument for the method to get input
4. Replace the hardcoded value with the argument variable

Cucumber Exceptions:
---------------------
UnDefinedStepException - When a step doesn't have implementation
DuplicateStepDefinitionException - When a step having more than 1 implementation

How to pass multiple data to a scenario:
-----------------------------------------
1. Scenario Outline keyword should be used
2. Examples should follow Scenario Outline
3. Define the column names inside || after Examples (first row for column names)
4. Second row onward give the data inside ||

Background: Used to have common precondition for all the scenarios in a feature file

Limitations:
------------
1. Background is not applicable for all the scenarios across multiple feature files
2. There is no keyword to execute common post condition
