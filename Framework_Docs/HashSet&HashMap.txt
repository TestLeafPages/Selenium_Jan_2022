Explain about HashSet and HashMap
	- When you like to store unique values (one dimensional) use HashSet like employee number
	- When you like to store unique key-value pair (2-dim), use HashMap like employee number : employee name
	- Both are classes implemented from Set, Map respectively.
	- HashSet usesÂ HashMap internally to store it's objects
	-Whenever, I need to store relational objects like say: incident number -> associated status ( I use HashMap)
	-It uses Hashing algorithm
